**Sinatra Stock Changing App**

This is an app designed for *Drosophila* researchers who want to keep track of when their fly stocks need to be changed to fresh food vials.  The app allows you to see when stock boxes have been changed and are due to be changed again.  You can also use the app to see all your stocks and the stock boxes that contain them, and to create, edit and delete stocks and stock boxes.

**Getting Started**

**Usage**

You must have Ruby installed on your machine.
